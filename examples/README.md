# Examples

Here you find some examples related to AgileTs.
We have tried to make them as simple as possible so that you get the most out of them.
Feel free to clone and test them to get a better understanding of AgileTs. Have fun.

The Examples are structured framework specific. So you can find React related examples in the `react` section.
Currently, we have examples for these frameworks:

- [react](./react)
- [react-native](./react-native)
