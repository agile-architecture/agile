# `react` Examples

Welcome, **React Developers**,
here you find all `react` related examples, which hopefully will take you one step further.
As you surely noticed, there are two sub-folders called `develop` and `release`.
Each of these two folders contains examples aimed at different target groups.

### `develop`

The `develop` examples are primarily intended for AgileTs contributors
to test new features and bug fixes in a production-like environment.
Therefore, we can see this section more as a playground for contributors.
In these examples, AgileTs is imported using [`yalc`](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).
`Yalc` is like a local npm store on your engine, which can be set up by following the guide on their [website](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

### `release`

The `release` examples target people who want to see how AgileTs work in production-like environments.
In these examples, AgileTs is imported as a release version.
Therefore, you can simply run them on your local machine without further thinking.
