The `react` package is a set of utilities that simplifies the way AgileTs is integrated into a [React](https://reactjs.org/) environment.
Think of it as an extension of AgileTs in the context of React
that serves as an interface to React Components.
The main task of the `react` integration is to bind AgileTs States to React Components.
This ensures that AgileTs will re-render the Component when the bound State changes.
It also provides some other valuable functionalities
that optimize the workflow with AgileTs in a React project.

A distinction is made between `Functional` and `Class` Components.
As we prefer to use [`React Hooks`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in Functional Components,
however, Hooks aren't supported in Class Components.
Therefore, we have created alternatives for Class Components
in order to offer the most essential functionalities there as well.

### üêÜ Functional Component
In `Functional Components` we recommend using AgileTs Hooks like [`useAgile()`](https://agile-ts.org/docs/react/hooks/#useagile).
The `useAgile()` Hook binds [Agile Sub Instances](https://agile-ts.org/docs/introduction#agile-sub-instance) 
(like States or Collections) to React Components for reactivity.
```ts
// -- MyComponent.jsx ------------------------------------------

// Binds MY_FIRST_STATE to 'MyComponent.jsx' for reactivity
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE);
```
To find out more about `useAgile()`, and other Hooks provided by AgileTs,
checkout the [AgileTs Hook documentation](https://agile-ts.org/docs/react/hooks).

### ü¶ñ Class Component
For `Class Components`, we provide the `AgileHOC`.
The `AgileHOC` is a Higher Order Component that is wrapped around a React Component.
It takes care of binding [Agile Sub Instances](https://agile-ts.org/docs/introduction#agile-sub-instance)
(like States or Collections) to the wrapped React Components for reactivity.
```ts
// -- MyComponent.jsx ------------------------------------------

// Binds MY_FIRST_STATE to 'MyComponent.jsx' for reactivyty
export default AgileHOC(myComponent, [MY_FIRST_STATE]);
```
To find out more about the `AgileHOC` and how to correctly use AgileTs in Class Components,
take a look at the [AgileHOC documentation](https://agile-ts.org/docs/react/AgileHOC).

```
npm install @agile-ts/react
```
The `react` package is an extension of AgileTs and doesn't work without the [`core`](https://agile-ts.org/docs/core) package,
which functions as the brain of AgileTs and is indispensable.
Unfortunately, we can't combine each `core` with `react` version.
Therefore, we have created a table that shows which versions fit together without restrictions.

| @agile-ts/react  | @agile-ts/core          | NPM Version              | Supported React versions | Supports hook based components    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------|---------------------------------- |
| v0.1.2+          | v0.1.2+                 | v6+                      | 16.8+                    | Yes                               |

_Older Versions aren't supported anymore_
