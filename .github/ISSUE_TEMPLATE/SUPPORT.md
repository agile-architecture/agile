Hey there! If you need help or tech support then this is not the place to ask. 
Please head to the [AgileTs Discord](https://discord.com/T9GzreAwPH) instead 
or post a question to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/agile-ts).

If you arrived here because you think AgileTs's documentation is unclear, 
insufficient or wrong, please consider creating an issue for the documentation instead.
