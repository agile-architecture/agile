# Contributing to AgileTs
We are open to, and grateful for, any contribution made by the community. 
If you're intrested in contributing to AgileTs, hopefully, this document makes the process for you more clear.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

## Get Involved
There are many ways to contribute to AgileTs. Here are a few ideas to get started:
- Simply start using AgileTs. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](#reporting-new-issues).
- Help to solve [open issues](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/issues) by suggesting workarounds or fixing them.
  Issues tagged as [_Good first issue_](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/labels/Good%20first%20issue) are a good place to get started.
- [Improve open issues](#improve-issues-and-pull-requests) to make them more clear and understandable for others.
- Read through the [AgileTs docs](https://agile-ts.org/docs). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, feel free to  make edits by clicking "Edit" at the bottom of the doc page. 
- Take a look at the [features requested](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/labels/enhancement) by others and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

### Join our Discord Server
Contributions are very welcome. 
If you think you need help planning your contribution, don't mind joining our [Discord Community](TODO) and let us know if you are looking for a bit of help.

### Improve Issues and Pull Requests

One great way you can contribute without writing _any_ code is to help to improve open issues and pull requests.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest [labels](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/labels) that can help categorize issues/pull-requests.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
